# 🏠 LocalCause: Digital Infrastructure for Local Heroes

**Technology as a Service, Not a Barrier.** Most volunteer-run organizations and small non-profits lack the budget or technical expertise to maintain a professional digital presence. **LocalCause** changes that by providing high-performance, zero-cost, and easily manageable websites using a "Factory" model.

---

### 🚀 The Mission
We bridge the digital divide by building a master architecture that allows local organizations to:
* **Eliminate Monthly Fees:** Hosted for free on Vercel.
* **Edit Visually:** Powered by TinaCMS for a "What You See Is What You Get" experience.
* **Launch Instantly:** A standardized, white-label blueprint that scales.

---

### 🛠️ For Developers & Contributors
The core logic and the "Website Factory" blueprint are maintained on our main development repository. 

**Are you a developer looking to help?** We welcome contributions, bug fixes, and feature requests at the master repository:
